        Let's say we have "bear" : "5"
        which just means that there are 5 bears in the areas
        
        But 5 is the value so we have to map bear to some sort of index.
        So we create a hash function with means we turn bear into integer 
        which then represents an index
        
        
        and when the user then uses list["bear"] 
        we hash bear again and we get the same index.
        
        Easy idea, is hashing for converting string into int. 'KEY' : 'VALUE' */
